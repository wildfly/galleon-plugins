#### Configuration generation

The configuration of the target installation is generated by executing WildFly CLI scripts collected from the packages making up the installation.

Based on the feature-pack and package dependencies, the PM tool determines the order in which the packages making up the installation should be installed. The WildFly provisioning plug-in then iterates through the packages in that order collecting CLI scripts that represent package-specific configuration snippets.

Once all the CLI scripts have been collected, the plug-in launches a CLI session, embeds the server with an empty configuration and runs the collected scripts.

[NOTE]
Note: *the scripts are not executed in a batch* (i.e. as a composite operation). In case some operations have to be combined into a batch, it is the responsibility of the package developer to start and run the batch from the script attached to the package.

In case any of the CLI command and/or operation fails, the whole provisioning process will be aborted by the PM tool.
