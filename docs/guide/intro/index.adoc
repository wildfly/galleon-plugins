## Introduction

WildFly Galleon Plugins project includes Galleon and Maven plugin implementations that are dedicated to 
building feature-packs (including generation of feature specs, packages and other resources) for WildFly releases and provisioning of WildFly-based distributions. 
These plugins can also be used by projects that integrate into or extend WildFly.

This Maven tooling allows to build feature-packs that can be combined with WildFly feature-packs to produce customized WildFly server installations.

The Maven plugin "org.wildfly.galleon:wildfly-galleon-maven-plugin" exposes 2 goals:

* `build-feature-pack`: A goal to be used by WildFly developers when defining WildFly feature-packs that 
implement new WidFly subsystems and expose new server capabilities.

* `build-user-feature-pack`: A goal to be used by WildFly server users in order to define new Layers, new JBoss Modules, ... that depend on existing WildFly 
subsystems and capabilities.
